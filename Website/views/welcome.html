			<h2>Like a good dinner</h2>
			<p>Movies and TV shows are like a good dinner: Do you really want to miss out on the whole experience just because you don't like the sprouts?</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>It's about choice</h2>
			<p>This project is not about censorship or automated filtering. It's about choice. You decide what is shown and what is not.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>No derivatives</h2>
			<p>Filter video and audio without having to change the original source material. No derivative videos needed! Thus your filters are legal and safe.</p>

			<h2>Voluntary and simple</h2>
			<p>There are better solutions than <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_rating_system">complex rating systems</a> forced upon you by government agencies and industry committees.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>No hardware, no costs</h2>
			<p>Buying special media players and getting proprietary filters really shouldn't be necessary. Everything is free, both as in <em>freedom</em> and in <em>free beer</em>.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>For art lovers</h2>
			<p>Film makers should <em>not</em> censor <em>anything</em>. They should release the film in the best, most complete and most artistic way possible.</p>
