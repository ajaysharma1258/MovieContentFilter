## How it works

 1. The community tags the source material, i.e. movies and TV shows, with filterable categories.
 1. You decide what you want to filter out and what you want to see. Customized filters are generated for you.
 1. Having chosen from various categories and severity levels, you will enjoy a comfortable viewing and hearing experience.

## Commercial providers

This project provides an open standard and shareable content under free licenses.

There are some commercial offerings with similar goals. However, these services provide only proprietary filters and often they are not available worldwide.
